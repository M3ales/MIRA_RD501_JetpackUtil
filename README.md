# Ace Speed Limiter Interactions

Allows you to quickly change between speed limits via ace interaction - exploitable at this point, since there is no curve for deceleration, and you get linearly set to the max speed. (Essentially instantly stopping with no drift or other issues).

Modded Arma 3 is great and everything the client says goes.
